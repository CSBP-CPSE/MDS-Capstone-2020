As patients begin to be transferred between units (eg; from lower level of care to a higher level of care), it has become apparent that the previous methods of identifying patients based on a 24-hour time period would count patients transferred between different locations twice; once in each location they were at during the course of the day.

As patients begin to be transferred between units (eg; from lower level of care to a higher level of care), it has become apparent that the previous methods of identifying patients based on a 24-hour time period would count patients transferred between different locations twice; once in each location they were at during the course of the day. In order to eliminate this issue, patients will no longer be counted over a 24 hour period, but will be counted at a single point in time (11:59 pm) to ensure that each person is only counted once.\n",

      "Ontario is working with its partners in the health care system implementing a robust plan to monitor for, detect and, if needed, isolate any cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The Ministry of Health is taking several steps to ensure the health and safety of Ontarians. This includes:\n",
      "enacting a declaration of emergency to help stop the spread and keep people safe\n",
      "monitoring hospitals for potential cases of the virus in individuals with travel history to areas under a travel health advisory for COVID-19\n",
      "adding the 2019 novel coronavirus as a designated disease reportable under Ontario's public health legislation, enabling local public health units to quickly and effectively take all necessary measures to investigate, complete lab tests and do case and contact management to prevent and control further spread of the infection\n",
      "ongoing planning with federal and provincial/territorial partners and readiness to coordinate with other provinces/territories\n",
      "through the work of the Command Table, refining and finalizing plans for the implementation of enhanced measures to ensure the province continues to be prepared to respond quickly and effectively to any scenario, including:\n",
      "enhanced access to screening\n",
      "expanding lab-testing capacity\n",
      "implementing new initiatives to keep the public and frontline workers safe\n",
