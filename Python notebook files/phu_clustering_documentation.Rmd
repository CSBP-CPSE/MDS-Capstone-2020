```{r read and clean data, include = F}
phu <- read.csv('../data/PMD-en/PHU_FINAL_prop.csv')
phu <- phu[,-c(1,2)]

# percent comorbidities clean ----
percents <- c('copd.percent', 'asthma.percent', 'smokers.percent', 'hbp.percent')
phu[,percents] <- lapply(phu[,percents], function(x) as.numeric(gsub("[\\%,]", "", x))/100)

# convert missing transit data to 0 ----
# (ASSUMPTION: there is no public transit in the corresponding PHU)
phu$prox_idx_transit[is.na(phu$prox_idx_transit)] <- 0

# PHU cols for pca ----
keep <- c('Location', 'asthma.percent', 'copd.percent', 'hbp.percent', 'smokers.percent', 
         'prox_idx_emp', 'prox_idx_pharma', 'prox_idx_childcare', 'prox_idx_health',
         'prox_idx_grocery', 'prox_idx_educpri', 'prox_idx_educsec', 'prox_idx_lib',
         'prox_idx_parks', 'prox_idx_transit')

phu_prop <- subset(phu, select = keep)

#assign names phu df
rownames(phu_prop) <- phu_prop$Location
```

### Agglomerative Clustering:

Data is first scaled then the euclidean distance is computed between each PHU. Clusters are formed based on least dissimilarities between observations.

*Group average clustering:* attempts to produce relatively compact that are relatively far apart.
*Complete clustering:* all union observations for two groups are least dissimilar - can produce clusters that violate "closeness" property (one observation may be more similar to observations in other groups).
*Single clustering:* grouped based on one dissimilarity measure common between two observations being very small - prone to chaining.

Single linkage appears to have chaining while average linkage groups are not as easily discernable. Complete linkage was chosen for further analysis.

```{r scale and dist, include = F}
#scale
phu_sc <- scale(phu_prop[,-1])

#euc distance between each PHU is ok because all var are quantitative
phu_dist <- dist(phu_sc)

#clust
comp <- hclust(phu_dist, method = "complete")
av <- hclust(phu_dist, method = "average")
sing <- hclust(phu_dist, method = 'single')

plot(comp, main = "Complete Linkage") # best, suggests 2 groups
plot(av, main = "Average Linkage") # chaining
plot(sing, main = "Single Linkage") # chaining

```

```{r complete clust, echo = F}
# comp clust better visualization ----
comp_dend <- as.dendrogram(comp)
comp_col_dend <- color_branches(comp_dend, h = 3)
plot(comp_col_dend, main = "Complete Linkage")
```

With 8 groups it seems as though there is too much separation...

```{r comp clust k 2, echo = F}

# 8 clusters according to previous plot ----
phu_cl <- mutate(phu_prop, cluster = cutree(comp, k = 8)) 
count(phu_cl,cluster)

# VIS: cluster groups ----
fviz_cluster(list(data = phu_cl[,-1], cluster = cutree(comp, k = 8)), 
             main = "Cluster Plot k = 8 - Agglomerative Complete Hierarchical Clustering")

```

With 3 groups it appears as though there is not enough separation...

```{r comp clust k 3, echo = F}

# 3 clusters according to previous plot ----
phu_cl <- mutate(phu_prop, cluster = cutree(comp, k = 3)) 
count(phu_cl,cluster)

# VIS: cluster groups ----
fviz_cluster(list(data = phu_cl[,-1], cluster = cutree(comp, k = 3)), 
             main = "Cluster Plot k = 3 - Agglomerative Complete Hierarchical Clustering")

```

The agglomerative coefficient for complete linkage:

```{r ac comp, echo = F}
paste("Aggloemeratice Coefficient: ", coef.hclust(comp))
```

```{r k 3, echo = F}
# VIS: bar plots ----
phu_cl <- mutate(phu_cl, CovidCaseStrat = phu$TotalStratified) 

ggplot(phu_cl, aes(x=fct_reorder(Location,CovidCaseStrat, .desc=F), y = CovidCaseStrat, fill = factor(cluster))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity")  +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "PHU", y = "Proportion of PHU with Covid Cases")

```

### Divisive Hierarchical Clustering - DIANA
All observations begin as a single cluster and are divisible separated based on largest average dissimilarity between an observation and all others.

Hierarchical clustering will always cluster even if there is no grouping in the data. The divisive coefficient is on a 0-1 scale, representing the extent to which the hierarchical structure produced by a dendrogram actually represents the data (closer to 1 = better representation).

```{r DIANA, echo = F}
hc <- diana(phu_dist)
paste("Divisive Coefficient: ", hc$dc)
```

```{r DIANA VIS, echo = F}
pltree(hc, cex = 0.6, hang = -1, main = "Dendrogram of DIANA")
clust <- cutree(hc, k = 4)
fviz_cluster(list(data = phu_dist, cluster = clust), main = "Cluster Plot DIANA - Divisive Hierarchical Clustering")

```

Covid Case Total Proportions (per PHU) data and DIANA cluster assignment are added to `phu_prop` to assess groupings by covid output.

```{r diana bar, echo = F}
# VIS: bar plots ----
phu_cl <- mutate(phu_prop, CovidCaseStrat = phu$TotalStratified) 
phu_cl <- mutate(phu_cl, cluster = clust) 


ggplot(phu_cl, aes(x=fct_reorder(Location,CovidCaseStrat, .desc=F), y = CovidCaseStrat, fill = factor(cluster))) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity")  +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "PHU", y = "Stratified Proportion of PHU with Covid Cases")

```


Looking at covid case proportions for each PHU coloured by transit proximity.

Peel and York have week transit proximity but high case proportions.

```{r by transit}
phu_cl <- mutate(phu_prop, CovidCaseStrat = phu$TotalStratified) 

ggplot(phu_cl, aes(x=fct_reorder(Location,CovidCaseStrat, .desc=F), y = CovidCaseStrat, fill = prox_idx_transit)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity")  +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "PHU", y = "Stratified Proportion of PHU with Covid Cases")


```

## Mixture Model Clustering Methods 

### EM Algorithm

Soft version of K-means clustering that is based on probabilities rather than deterministic assignments of points to groups. Used package `Mclust`.

For all parameters:

```{r EM all params, include = F}
# EM by all params ----
mphu <-Mclust(phu_prop, G=1:3)
plot(mphu, what="classification")
```


Between PHU and Stratified Proportion of Cases:

```{r EM cases, include = F}
# EM by total cases ----
mcovid <- Mclust(phu[,21], G=1:2)
plot(mcovid, what="classification")
```

```{r EM case classes}
# EM view clasess ----
classes <- mutate(as.data.frame(mcovid$classification), loc = phu$Location)
colnames(classes)[1] <- 'class'
classes <- classes[order(classes),][1:36,]
classes
```


### Multidimensional Scaling

Uses euclidean distances of scaled PHU data. Similarly represents hierarchical clustering (Toronto is its own cluster, denser regions such as Peel, Halton, York, Waterloo, Ottawa...etc. separate from smaller districts).

```{r}
labels(phu_dist)
plot(cmdscale(phu_dist)[,1], cmdscale(phu_dist)[,2], type = "n", 
     xlab = "", ylab = "", 
     asp = 1, axes = FALSE, 
     main = "MDS Results on phu_dist")
text(cmdscale(phu_dist)[,1], cmdscale(phu_dist)[,2], rownames(cmdscale(phu_dist)), cex = 0.6)


```

# Clustering with only `amenity` cols

```{r}
amenity_keep <- c('Location', 'asthma.percent', 'copd.percent', 'hbp.percent', 'smokers.percent', 'amenity')

phu_amen <- subset(phu, select = amenity_keep)

rownames(phu_amen) <- phu_amen$Location

```


```{r scale and dist2, include = F}
#scale
phu_amen_sc <- scale(phu_amen[,-1])

#euc distance between each PHU is ok because all var are quantitative
phu_dist2 <- dist(phu_amen_sc)

#clust
comp2 <- hclust(phu_dist2, method = "complete")
av2 <- hclust(phu_dist2, method = "average")
sing2 <- hclust(phu_dist2, method = 'single')

plot(comp2, main = "Complete Linkage") # best, suggests 2 groups
plot(av2, main = "Average Linkage") # chaining
plot(sing2, main = "Single Linkage") # chaining

```

```{r complete clust2, echo = F}
# comp clust better visualization ----
comp_dend2 <- as.dendrogram(comp2)
comp_col_dend2 <- color_branches(comp_dend2, h = 3)
plot(comp_col_dend2, main = "Complete Linkage")
```

```{r}
# 2 clusters according to previous plot ----
phu_amen_cl <- mutate(phu_amen, cluster = cutree(comp2, k = 2)) 
count(phu_amen_cl,cluster)

# VIS: cluster groups ----
fviz_cluster(list(data = phu_amen_cl[,-1], cluster = cutree(comp2, k = 2)), 
             main = "Agglomerative Complete Hierarchical Clustering, k = 2")+   scale_colour_manual(values=c("#46A5FE", "#E69F00")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#46A5FE", "#E69F00"))
