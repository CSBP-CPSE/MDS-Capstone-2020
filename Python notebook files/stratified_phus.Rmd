# Stratifying the Covid Cases

DBs were grouped by PHU and sum `DBPOP` (population of PHU). Stratified weights were calculated by $phu_{weight}*phu_{proportion}$

where 

$phu_{weight} = \frac{phu_{pop}}{ontario_{census}}$

and

$phu_{proportion} = \frac{cases}{phu_{pop}}$.

```{r}
phu <- read.csv('../data/PMD-en/PHU_FINAL_prop.csv')
phu <- phu[,-c(1,2)]
```
