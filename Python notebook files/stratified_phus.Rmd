# Stratifying the Covid Cases

DBs were grouped by PHU and sum `DBPOP` (population of PHU).

```{r}
phu <- read.csv('../data/PMD-en/PHU_FINAL_prop.csv')
phu <- phu[,-c(1,2)]
```

Determine stratified weights of PHU relative to Ontario:

$W_{phu} = PHU/Ontario$

```{r phu weights}
phu$phu_weight <- phu$DBPOP/phu$Census
```

Multiply $W_{phu}$ by PHU case proportions (case count/phu population) to determine sample estimates of cases for each PHU:

```{r}
phu$TotalStratified <- phu$phu_weight*phu$TOTALprop
```

# GLM

```{r}

```
