```


```{r}

summary(pc2)
```

```{r}
pc2$rotation[,1:2]
```
PC1: higher comorbidities, more detached homes, less amenity dense, higher age of population, less higher education, poorer mental and physical health

PC2: higher cost of living, high rises, more employment, perceived high stress, more commuting altogether and more vehical transit usage, percieved good health, less not (more) amenity dense? => *possibly indicative of a city*

With commute time, all variables load onto one component.
```{r}
factanal(df2, factors = 2)
```
